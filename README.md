Hello!

I am [Alexander](https://www.google.com/search?q=alexander+meaning).

My area of expertise is the software engineering of software-intensive mechatronic systems, in particular the design of software architectures.

Here I try to do my best to contribute to designs that are fun for us developers and at the same time are cornerstones for a long-term competitive product.

In my career, I have gained experience as a software and system developer, architect, teacher of computer science, mathematics and mechatronics after school, community service and mechanical engineering studies, i.e. since 2001.

Previously, I worked at [TU-Darmstadt](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/index.en.jsp), [Continental](https://www.continental.com/en/), [Berufsbildende Schule Technik Mainz](https://www.bbs1-mainz.com/), [AKASOL](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/BorgWarner_Akasol) (now part of BorgWarner) and [Marquardt Group](https://www.marquardt.com/us/).

I currently work for the VITRONIC Group.

Even in my free time, I can't get enough of software, electronics and mechanics. I am a fan-boy of git, VSCode, Sphinx and GitHub.

Besides technology, I enjoy endurance sports on land and in the water, sweet and even more salty. I love the breathless depths of freediving and the expansive views in the mountains.
