Hello, I'm [Alexander](https://www.google.com/search?q=alexander+meaning).

My domain is Software and Systems ProductLine Engineering of Mechatronics in the Automotive Industry.

My focus lies in helping colleagues in Research and Development with their technical, process and cultural transformation.

After my school, civil service and studies in mechanical engineering, so since 2001, I am software and systems engineer, architect and also teacher in computer science, mathematics and mechatronics.

Beside engineering I enjoy endurance sports at land or in the water, sweet and even more salty. I love the breathless depths of free diving and the expansive views in the mountains.
